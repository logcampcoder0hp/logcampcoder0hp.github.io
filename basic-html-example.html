    <h1>The page of a Babylon 5 fanatic</h1>
    <p>This site is about the TV show <img alt="Babylon 5"
        src="http://brainstomping.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/babylon5.jpg"
        height="450" width="800">. It was a really cool show. The
      characters were very real and well developed. A whole lot happens
      in the show. There are several wars, some going on at the same
      time. Some took place before the series takes place, but were
      referenced because of their impact to the present. The Dilgar war,
      the Minbari war, the Narn-Centari war, just to name a few. </p>

    <p>There are other characters not listed, some of whom are major
      characters in the series, but the above list, I think, covers the
      characters who I like. But my top five characters are: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Londo Mollari <img alt="Ambassador Mollari"

    <p>I like Londo Mollari because although he starts out as an amusing
      character who is always running around, late for an appointment
      because he is always loosing the time (and his money) at the
      casino, he changes and becomes (SPOILER ALERT) a very dark
      character who is instrumental in causing the Centauri to become a
      big bully race. But even when he watches the Narn homeworld being
      bombarded, he looks extremely unhappy. He nevertheless plays the
      role he must at every turn of his life and drinks right down to
      the dregs of the cup, and he does everything very well; he knows
      how to be an excelient ambassador and how to accomplish what needs
      to be done to replace the emperor for the sake of the Centarui
      people. I think that what I really like about him is that his
      feelings on what he would like to do are so different from what he
      feels that he must do and therefore does. </p>
    <p>G'Kar on the other hand, I like him because his emotions are more
      closely correlated with his actions. He is not in so many
      situations where he feels that he must do things because of social
      consequences, he does what he does because it is in his interests,
      which normally includes the interest of the Narn people. </p>
    <p>Michael Garibaldi is a great character, because has personal
      problems, most of which stem from his occasional years struggling
      with alcohol. </p>
    <p>Alfred Bester Can be cold as a snake, and bite as severely, but
      even he shows that he has human soft-spots and higher goals in
      life that motivate him to be extremely shrewd. Also, he has a
      handicap, one of his hands is lame. One wonders how he puts the
      gloves on. </p>
    <p>Vir Cotto has some kind of inexplicable innocence. He is too
      unimportant to kill, or generally be noticed. Hmm, now how might
      that be handy? </p>
